# ROR_TPL
Ruby-On-Rails Clarion template framework

This is a start to getting a Clarion template chain framework for ruby-on-rails.

The project was used to gain some experience on how to create a template chain for another language. At the time this was started Ruby was the up and comming language. The Ruby-On-Rails framework was providing a lot of value for the time and effort used. So this was started and the few pieces actually work.

The realization came quickly that creating a whole template chain from scratch including all the supporting components would be more time than was available at that moment. So the project was stopped. 

And while the framework for this particular language is not being developed, the framework structure is valid. And this framework could be used as a start to a template chain for Python, .NET, elixir, or any other computer language of your choice.
